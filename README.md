#  Sales Performance Analysis Project

This project is a comprehensive sales performance analysis conducted using SQL, Python (Jupyter Notebook), and Power BI, based on the **Superstore Dataset**. It showcases how structured data can be transformed into meaningful business insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and query-based insights.

##  Files in the Repository

- superstore dataset.xlsx - The raw dataset used for analysis.
- Sales_Performance_Analysis .ipynb - Python notebook for EDA and visualization.
- Sales Performance Analysis .pbix - Power BI dashboard for interactive insights.
- sql project.pdf - SQL queries grouped by complexity (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced).

##  Objectives

- Explore and understand sales, profit, and customer behavior patterns.
- Analyze performance by region, segment, and category.
- Identify top-selling and underperforming products.
- Use SQL for structured querying and Power BI for data storytelling.

##  Tools Used

- **SQL**: For querying and analytical computations.
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**: For EDA, data cleaning, and basic visualizations.
- **Power BI**: For creating a dynamic, visual dashboard.
- **Excel**: As the base format for the Superstore dataset.

##  Analysis Highlights

### SQL Queries
Queries are categorized into:
- **Basic**: Total sales, order counts, unique categories, etc.
- **Intermediate**: Average discounts, customer segmentation, product performance.
- **Advanced**: Lifetime value analysis, product pairing (market basket), profitability impact of discounts.

### Python (EDA)
Performed operations such as:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Correlation analysis between sales, profit, discount, and quantity.
- Visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Power BI
- Built dashboards covering KPIs like total sales, profit trends, category-wise analysis, and region-wise breakdown.
- Interactive filters and slicers for detailed exploration.

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights
The Consumer segment brought the highest profit.

Technology was the most profitable category.

Discounts beyond a threshold hurt profitability.

California had the highest sales volume, but not necessarily the highest profit.
